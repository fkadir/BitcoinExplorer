# BitcoinExplorer

UGHHHHHHH

The aim of this assignment is to develop a working Bitcoin blockchain viewer application. This
should be similar in spirit to existing viewers such as the Blockchain Explorer, although the scope
and complexity is expected to be much smaller. The application should display blocks as they are
mined by the Bitcoin system. For each block, it should display:
• The date and time that the block was added to the blockchain, formatted in a human
readable form (e.g. 1st April 2023 at 20:40)
• A list of the transactions in the block, and the value of each transaction
• The nonce that was used to successfully hash the block, and the difficulty level
• Verify that that hash does indeed match the hash included in the block!
